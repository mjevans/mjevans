# Michael James Evans
## Seeking Employment
### Software Engineer, SRE, DevOps, Network Engineer, OR Information Security
* I enjoy creating, maintaining, and supporting systems and automation which enrich everyone
* Secure, reliable, fault resistant and fail-safe solutions are my passion
* Adaptive and widely versed in computer related subjects

### Practice Projects
[Practice Projects](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice)
Logic Puzzles solved by code and 'redemption challenges' for anything I stumble on in an interview.  Practice of how to write better code, as well as review and revision of any concept.  Though the redemption will focus on the general idea I got tripped up by, not any precise examples.
* [Euler Problems, in Golang](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice/euler/go)
* [Revisit: JSON parse](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice/refresh/jsonparse)

### Project Euler problem - skill demonstration

Unit Testing
* While every problem ends up as it's own unit test, I've been trying to add [tests](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice/euler/go/euler/pe_euler_test.go) for most parts of the [library of shared code](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice/euler/go/euler/pe_euler.go).  Where there are known specifications to match a block of numbers often makes a test.  Where there's specific behavior I expect I add that as a test.  Sometimes example cases come from failure analysis when things go wrong.  Other times I mentally walk through the general goal of a function's specification and try to envision corner / edge cases, such as modular wraps for unsigned integers.

Data Structures
* [#61 Cyclical Figurate Numbers](euler/go/pe_0061.go) The question's asked in a quirky way, but I had more fun with the real question.  Learn how to think like a database with a non-so-trivial example.

Algorithms Euler's problems frequently focus on specific math puzzles.  I'm most proud of the problems that I could solve entirely on my own.
* [#59 XOR Decryption](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice/euler/go/pe_0059.go) I wanted to include this more for the fun I had than how difficult it was.  There was some trial and error with the isValid() function.

* [#63 Powerful Digit Counts](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice/euler/go/pe_0063.go) I quickly got to the core of the logic.
* [#67 Maximum Path Sum II](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice/euler/go/pe_0067.go) library function [euler.MaximumPathSum](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice/blob/99b8a9930ffaab34b7c6a3692cdd3e4fb3a55c55/euler/go/euler/pe_euler.go#L2048)
* [#68 Magic 5-gon ring](https://github.com/mjevans/code-practice/euler/go/pe_0068.go)
